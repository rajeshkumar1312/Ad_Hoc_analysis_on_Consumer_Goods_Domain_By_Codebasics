## Company overview/Problem Statement

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. 
They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. 
Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. 
Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.
#### Task
- There are 10 ad hoc requests to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
- The target audience of this Project is top-level management ‚Äì and  create a presentation to show the insights.
